# Client for api platform using React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Guidelines: https://api-platform.com/docs/client-generator/react/
For generating react reducers, components, actions, etc for customers I used: api-platform/client-generator

## Available Scripts

To run project locally:

### `yarn install`
### `yarn build`

### `yarn start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

NOTICE! the client does not work correctly!
